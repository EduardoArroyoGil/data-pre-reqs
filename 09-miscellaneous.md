#9. Miscellaneous
### Extra

##### Tableau
```bash
brew install --cask tableau
```


##### Spectacle
This, of course, is completely optional, but is very useful when you need to have your Terminal side to side to your VSC: https://www.spectacleapp.com

You can either download it from their website or run this command in your terminal:
```bash
brew install --cask spectacle
```
